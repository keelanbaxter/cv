  <h1>Keelan Baxter</h1>
  <p><em>Student and Web Developer</em></p>
  <p>I enjoy hiking in British Columbia's great outdoor environment, photography of landscapes, coding in HTML / CSS and researching stocks & participating in investment activities related to the Stock Market!

    I graduated in 2014 and accumulated nearly 8 years of work experience that varies in different fields, such as highly competitive sales, construction, and oil & gas.

  <p>

    An achievement of mine is being a volunteer firefighter, as well as becoming a top-performing sales associate with The Source by Bell Canada, and achieving consistent monthly sales goals and high performance in sales metrics during my time spent
    with the company.


    An additional achievement of mine is successfully being the only student in my program to complete a BC Hydro sponsored program for 'Essential Skills for Trades', a program that taught me basic business skills, mathematics, and communications.
